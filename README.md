### I'm a Software Enginer 

I'm a open source enthusiastic. I only use Linux as a desktop and I try automatize everything with IOT projects using ESP and Arduino

## Skills: C/C++ / Python / Web (CSS,HTML,Javascript) / LaTeX 

## Undergoing Projects

- Iâ€™m writing a book [Complete and Free Introduction to Mathematics](https://github.com/Matheus-Mota1/Complete_and_Free_Introduction_to_Mathematics). Using LaTeX
- Working on my first version of [Mot Maitrise](https://github.com/Matheus-Mota1/Moitrise), a program for increasing vocabulary and language expertise a **scrapper** in python that gets sentences through the internet and use text-to-speech to generate a audio of the sentences being pronounce as most accurate as possible. Probably going to be an extension for Anki.
- I'm improving my [RC Plane](https://github.com/Matheus-Mota1/Airplane-RC-Control) and also it's code. Planning to do a Youtube video teaching everything I've learn through the process.
